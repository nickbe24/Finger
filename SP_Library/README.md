This is the Arduino library for the 3-DoF series-parallel finger. This library contains the CANopen functions neccessary to control the MC3001 motor controllers, CPP versions of the kinematic functions, and 
accompanying neccessary mathimatic functions. Use
#include <Arduino_CAN.h>
#include <SP_Hand.h>
in order to appropriately use all functions.
